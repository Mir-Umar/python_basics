    "## Generators in Python\n",
    "#### -> In Python, a generator is a special type of iterable, similar to lists, tuples, and dictionaries, but with a key difference: generators do not store their values in memory all at once. Instead, they generate values on the fly as you iterate over them. This makes generators memory-efficient and particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or when you want to generate values dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### -> Generators are created using functions with one or more ***yield*** statements. When a function contains a yield statement, it becomes a generator function. When you call a generator function, it returns a generator object, which can be used to iterate over the values it produces."

    "#### Key characteristics and advantages of generators in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory Efficiency**: Generators are memory-efficient because they don't store all values in memory simultaneously. They generate values as needed, which is especially useful for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lazy Evaluation**: Values are generated on-the-fly as you iterate over the generator, allowing you to work with infinite sequences or streams of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: Generator functions are often simpler to write and read compared to creating and managing custom iterable classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pause and Resume**: Generator functions can be paused and resumed, maintaining their internal state between iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Infinite Sequences**: Generators are suitable for creating infinite sequences, like the Fibonacci sequence or an infinite stream of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient Iteration**: They are efficient for one-time iteration. Once a value is generated and consumed, it's not stored in memory, reducing memory overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's built-in functions like range(), map(), and filter() also return generators in Python 3, enhancing performance and memory efficiency."
